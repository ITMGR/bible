* Licensing Quibbles
Before I get into anything else, I'd like to say that I'm releasing
the TeX sources to everything but the /pure content/ of the
translations as Creative Commons BY-SA.  Each bible contains a
LICENSE.tex file that details the license for that particular
translation/version.  For example, the KJV TeX sources are /public
domain/, but its class file (that which actually /formats/ the
content) is in fact CC-BY-SA.  Thus, you are free to do whatever you
will with the content of the KJV, but its layout is under Creative
Commons.

Similarly, all other (future) versions will have a separate license
for their content as opposed to their layout.
