(genesis 3:16) Rule=
It's interesting that, before the Fall, men and women were implicitly equal in every way.
There was no favoritism, there was no rule over another.
After the fall, the man assumed leadership over the woman, since the woman was the one who screwed up.  (Everything to be taken with a grain of salt?)
Now, in Christ, such a relationship is strained.
Both man and woman equally follow Christ.
Do wives yet submit to their husbands?
